[Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland has written a letter to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/house-democrats-push-congressional-investigation-trumps-conflicts-interest) requesting a congressional investigation into the President-Elect's financial arrangements.
Today, I am calling my congressional representative. Here's what I plan to say:

>"Hello, I am a constituent of {INSERT NAME} from {INSERT LOCATION} and I would like to know if he is planning on releasing a statement supporting Congressman Elijah Cummings's request that the Oversight Committee immediately investigate Donald Trump's financial arrangements for potential conflicts of interest."

Is it quixotic to expect that a committee chaired by Congressman Jason Chaffetz will actually act on this? Perhaps. But make them own this. Make some noise.

Don't know who represents you in the House? Find your congressional representative [here](http://www.house.gov/).
