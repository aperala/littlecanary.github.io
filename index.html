  <h1>What Now?</h1>
  <p>Like a lot of people, I've been looking for ways to channel my emotion into productive action. As part of that, I've been reading a lot of advice from people wiser than I am. I wanted to gather all that I've bookmarked or favorited in one place.  I'll update it with more as I have time. Suggestions welcome: tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetsofneets" target="_blank">@tweetsofneets</a>.</p>

  <h2>Read and Understand</h2>
  <p>Here are a few perspectives that I have found helpful in understanding what's happening and what is yet to come.</p>

  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <p>1. Call your representatives. Get all your friends to call, too.</p>

  <p>To make it easier to make a habit of doing this, put your federal, state, and municipal representatives in your phone's contacts. Then share those with your family and neighbors. If you're not sure who represents you, you can look up their names <a href="https://www.270towin.com/elected-officials/" target="_blank">here</a>. NYC residents can find all their elected representatives with contact information at <a href="http://www.mygovnyc.org/" target="_blank">mygovnyc.org</a>.</p>
  <p> 2. Contact your local and state representatives. What you say and what you need from them will vary depending on where you live, so you'll need to figure this out. But demand that they get the ball rolling. My city council member is holding a strategy meeting with his constiutents this weekend&mdash;is yours? Has your mayor, your police department, your governor, issued any kind of statement?</p>
  <p>3. Keep in communication with your friends, your neighbors, your local business owners, and local organizations. Gather the skills, resources, and influence you have and figure out how to leverage that to help the most vulnerable. Be there for each other. Offline is better.</p>

  <h2>Don't be silent</h2>
    <p>If you see someone being harassed or targeted, don't stay silent. Here are some tips on how to intervene:</p>
    <p>This illustrated guide is by Maeril, an art blogger living in Paris. It was intended for instances of Islamophobic harrassment but applies equally to other situations:
