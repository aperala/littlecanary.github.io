  <h1>What Now?</h1>
  <p>This is a place where I'm going to gather some links, resources, and suggestions. Most of this is not original, but I wanted to collect it in one place. I'll update it with more as I have time. Next up: a book list, so all you teachers and booksellers out there let me know what we should be reading.</p>

  <h2>Read and Understand</h2>
  <p>Here are a few perspectives that I have found helpful in understanding what's happening and what is yet to come.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Masha Gessen, <a href="http://www2.nybooks.com/daily/s3/nov/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival.html" target="_blank">"Autocracy, Rules for Survival,"</a> <em>The New York Review of Books</em></li>
    <li>Sarah Kendzior, <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/5575/our-fate-was-sealed-long-before-november-8-and-not-because-the-elections-rigged/1576889402275-7591b019" target="_blank">"Our Fate Was Sealed Long Before November 8..."</a> The Correspondent</li>
    <li>Teju Cole, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/magazine/a-time-for-refusal.html" target="_blank">"A Time for Refusal,"</a> <em>The New York Times Magazine</em></li>
    <li>Liel Leibovitz, <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/217831/what-to-do-about-trump" target="_blank">"What to Do About Trump? The Same Thing My Grandfather Did in 1930s Vienna,"</a> <em>Tablet</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <p>1. Call your representatives. Let me clarify, call <em>your</em> representatives. However well-intentioned, calling an Arizona senator when you are a resident of New York is a waste of time. (Instead, tell your friends in Arizona to call their senator.)</p>

  <p>To make it easier to make a habit of doing this, put your federal, state, and municipal representatives in your phone's contacts. Then share those with your family and neighbors. If you're not sure who represents you, you can look up their names <a href="https://www.270towin.com/elected-officials/" target="_blank">here</a>. NYC residents can find all their elected representatives with contact information at <a href="http://www.mygovnyc.org/" target="_blank">mygovnyc.org</a>.</p>
  <p> 2. Contact your local and state representatives. What you say and what you need from them will vary depending on where you live, so you'll need to figure this out. But demand that they get the ball rolling. My city council member is holding a strategy meeting with his constiutents this weekend&mdash;is yours? Has your mayor, your police department, your governor, issued any kind of statement?</p>
  <p>3. Keep in communication with your friends, your neighbors, your local business owners, and local organizations. Gather the skills, resources, and influence you have and figure out how to leverage that to help the most vulnerable. Be there for each other. Offline is better.</p>

  <h2>Donate your time and/or money</h2>
    <p>Find a cause you believe in, and dedicate your time and/or money to it. Below is just a handful of national organizations. Do seek out <strong>local</strong> groups that need your help and your skills (legal expertise, language/translation, counseling, computer skills, organization, etc.).</p>

    <em><small>Me to every journalist right now</small></em>
  </p>
  <p>We need strong, independent journalism willing to give up access if that means being free to provide honest reporting. You know about the big national papers (<em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>), but subscribe to your local newspaper (if you still have one). Here's some reporting this year that I found worth supporting:</p>
